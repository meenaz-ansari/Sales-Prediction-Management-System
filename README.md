In the current e-commerce world, not every customer produces significant amount of revenue to the business and a thumb rule of 80-20 holds good. This poses a significant challenge for marketing teams to understand the revenue generating base of the customers. Deriving actionable insights from Google Analytics would help or enable them to optimize their re-targeting and remarketing strategies and eventually improve their Return on Investment (ROI) from marketing. This can be scaled for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of Google Analytics. We will be deploying classification and regression algorithms (Supervised Learning) to identify revenue generating customers, forecast the revenue generated by the identified customer and finally formulate their lifetime value.
